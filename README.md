**Sponge** is a powerful development framework that integrates `code generation`, `Gin`, and `gRPC`. It offers a rich set of code generation commands, allowing flexible creation of various functional modules that can be combined into complete services (similar to how scattered sponge cells can reorganize into a new sponge). Sponge provides an all-in-one solution for project development, covering code generation, development, testing, API documentation, and deployment, significantly enhancing development efficiency, reducing complexity, and enabling high-quality projects with a "low-code approach".

Sponge is used to quickly and efficiently develop high-performance back-end services for various application scenarios and requirements, including `web` services, `gRPC` services, `http+gRPC` hybrid services, `gRPC gateway API` services.

Sponge not only supports code generation based on Sponge's built-in templates but also allows generating code using custom templates and relevant parameters (e.g., JSON, SQL, Protobuf). Through custom templates, users can generate code required for various projects, without being limited to the Go language.

<br>

### Sponge Core Design Philosophy

Sponge's core design concept is to reversely generate modular code through `SQL` or `Protobuf` files. These codes can be flexibly and seamlessly combined into various types of backend services, thus greatly improving development efficiency and simplifying backend service development. Sponge has implemented three core functions:

- If you develop a web or gRPC service with only CRUD API, you don't need to write any go code to compile and deploy it to Linux servers, dockers, k8s, and you just need to connect to the database (e.g., `mysql`, `mongodb`,`postgresql`,`sqlite`) to automatically generate the complete backend service go code by sponge.
- If you develop general web, gRPC, http+gRPC, gRPC gateway services, you only need to focus on the three parts of `define tables in the database`, `define API description information in the protobuf file`, and `fill in business logic code in the generated template file`, and other go codes (including CRUD api) are generated by sponge.
- Sponge generates the necessary code for various projects through custom templates and parameters, such as frontend code, backend code, test code, deployment scripts, etc.

### Sponge Generates the Code Framework

#### Generate Code Framework

The code generation framework based on Sponge's built-in templates is shown below. There are two approaches: SQL and Protobuf.

### Microservice framework

The service code generated by sponge is itself a microservice, the framework diagram is shown below, which is a typical microservice hierarchical structure, with high performance, high scalability, contains commonly used service governance features, you can easily replace or add their own service governance features.

Performance testing of http and grpc service code created by the microservices framework: 50 concurrent, 1 million total requests.

### Project Code Directory Structure

The project code directory structure created by sponge follows the [project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).

Here is the directory structure for the generated `monolithic application single repository (monolith)` or `microservice multi-repository (multi-repo)` code:

```bash
.
├── api            # Protobuf files and generated * pb.go directory
├── assets         # Store various static resources, such as images, markdown files, etc.
├── cmd            # Program entry directory
├── configs        # Directory for configuration files

├── pkg            # Directory for shared libraries.
├── scripts        # Directory for scripts.
├── test           # Directory for scripts required for testing services  and test SQL.

```

Here is the directory structure for the generated `microservice monolithic repository (mono-repo)` code (also known as large repository directory structure):

```bash
.
├── api
│    ├── server1       # Protobuf files and generated *pb.go directory for service 1.
│    ├── server2       # Protobuf files and generated *pb.go directory for service 2.
│    ├── server3       # Protobuf files and generated *pb.go directory for service 3.
│    └── ...
├── server1        # Code directory for Service 1, it has a similar structure to the microservice multi repo directory.
├── server2        # Code directory for Service 2, it has a similar structure to the microservice multi repo directory.
├── server3        # Code directory for Service 3, it has a similar structure to the microservice multi repo directory.
├── ...
├── third_party    # Third-party protobuf files.
├── go.mod         # Go module dependencies and version control file.

### Quick start

#### Installation sponge

Sponge can be installed on Windows, macOS, Linux and Docker environments. Click here for [instructions on installing sponge](https://github.com/zhufuyi/sponge/blob/main/assets/install-en.md).

#### Starting UI service

After installing the sponge, start the UI service:

```bash
sponge run
```

Access `http://localhost:24631` in a local browser and manipulate the generated code on the UI page.

> If you want to access it on a cross-host browser, you need to specify the host ip or domain name when starting the UI, example `sponge run -a http://your_host_ip:24631`. It is also possible to start the UI service on docker to support cross-host access, Click for instructions on [starting the sponge UI service in docker](https://github.com/zhufuyi/sponge/blob/main/assets/install-en.md#docker-environment).
